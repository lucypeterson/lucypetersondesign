For the first time at CCA multiple design divisions came together to exhibit their thesis work in the same space.</p>\n<p><strong>Role:</strong> managing the printing and installation of the exhibition graphics, helping to build the installations in space (see the cardboard wall in the images). I also assisted the artists from all three disciplines install their work. I de-installed the show, coordinating the donations of extra materials.</p>\n<p><strong>Learnings:</strong> This project allowed me to learn strong project management skills, how to produce a successful event, and think about space and how tactility and dimensionality could exist in the work I do.</p>",
