That the division between art, design, illustration, architecture, and new media are dissolving. That graphic design is the invisible thread through these diverse practices.</p><p class="p1"><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Graphic design students</p><p class="p2"><strong>The Solution:</strong> We created a series of  tactile type explorations that resulted in the identity system for the lecture series and art show. With a loose color and typeface guidelines we experimented with a variety of dimensional ways to communicate and document our message, including a large scale type installation.</p><p class="p1">For the art show, We invited students to submit any work they had created that produced something tactile – this could be through output or through process. The result was a diverse showing, no two mediums were the same, ranging from paper to live performances.</p></div></article><article class="article"><img src="https://lucypetersondesign.com/media/posts/96/Tactile-1.jpeg" sizes="" srcset="" alt=""></article><article class="article"><img src="https://lucypetersondesign.com/media/posts/95/Tactile_StudentExhibition.jpeg" sizes="" srcset="" alt=""></article><article class="article"><img src="https://lucypetersondesign.com/media/posts/94/Tactile_Social.jpg" sizes="" srcset="" alt=""></article><article class="article"><img src="https://lucypetersondesign.com/media/posts/91/tactilegif.png" sizes="" srcset="" alt=""></article><article class="article"><img src="https://lucypetersondesign.com/media/posts/90/process.jpg" sizes="" srcset="" alt=""></article><article class="article"><li class="next"><a href="https://lucypetersondesign.com/good-american.html">Good American</a></li><li class="next"><a href="https://lucypetersondesign.com/7-for-all-mankind.html">7 For All Mankind</a></li><li class="next"><a href="https://lucypetersondesign.com/signature-by-levi-strauss-and-co.html">Signature By Levi Strauss &amp; Co.</a></li><li class="next"><a href="https://lucypetersondesign.com/denizen-from-levis.html">Denizen from Levi&#x27;s</a></li><li class="next"><a href="https://lucypetersondesign.com/Pottery-Barn-Kids-Catalog.html">Pottery Barn Kids Catalog</a></li><li class="next"><a href="https://lucypetersondesign.com/catharine-clark-gallery.html">Catharine Clark Gallery</a></li><li class="next"><a href="https://lucypetersondesign.com/save-the-night-identity.html">Save the Night Identity System</a></li></article></main><script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js?ver=1.3.2"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://lucypetersondesign.com/assets/js/jquery.mousewheel.min.js?v=1a85d0ce9b927ad1cde336fb619ea115"></script><script>$(function() {
